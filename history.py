Python was created in the late 1989 by Guido van Rossum
at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as
a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL), capable of
exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.
Its implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum's
long influence on Python is reflected in the title given 
to him by the Python community: Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL) â€“ 
a post from which he stepped down in July 2018.
